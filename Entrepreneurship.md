## Entrepreneurship

### 🚀 Suyi Translation (速译)

Suyi Translation was originally co-founded in **2017** with my classmates as an extension of a university class assignment. What began as an academic project evolved into a cross-border digital translation platform serving international students and migrant communities.

I currently serve as **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**, leading the technical development and platform architecture.

My work focuses on:

- AI-assisted translation workflow optimisation using machine learning–driven task prioritisation and quality control  
- natural language processing (NLP) for document classification, information extraction, and translation pre-processing  
- predictive analytics for turnaround time estimation, pricing optimisation, and demand forecasting  
- behavioural data modelling to understand customer decision patterns and service selection behaviour  
- WeChat mini-program and SaaS platform development with embedded AI decision support  
- cross-border digital service infrastructure and automation  
- payment integration (Stripe, WeChat Pay, Alipay) and transaction workflow optimisation  
- scalable order management, recommendation logic, and process automation

The platform now operates across Australia, Canada, and Asia, supporting certified translation services (NAATI, ATIO, STIBC) in 90+ languages with both digital and physical delivery.

This entrepreneurial journey informs my academic interests in AI adoption, digital platforms, and behavioural analytics.
