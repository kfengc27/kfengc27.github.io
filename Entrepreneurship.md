### 🚀 Suyi Translation (速译) [https://www.suyitranslation.com](https://www.suyitranslation.com)

Suyi Translation was originally co-founded in **2017** with my classmates as an extension of a university class assignment. What began as a small student project evolved into a cross-border digital translation platform serving international students and migrant communities.

I currently serve as **Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Board Director**, leading the technical development and platform architecture.


The platform now operates across Australia, Canada, American and Asia, supporting certified translation services (NAATI, ATIO, STIBC, ATA etc) in 90+ languages with both digital and physical delivery.

This entrepreneurial journey informs my academic interests in AI adoption, digital platforms, and behavioural analytics.
