My name is Chengbin Feng. I like to explore the world from the perspective of mathematics and computers, and my interdisciplinary background has enriched my knowledge. In addition, I have a wide range of hobbies, can play some musical instruments and draw, and am good at playing basketball. To be an independent, professional, and cool researcher has been my dream since childhood. I am currently conducting scientific research at The University of New South Wales.

## Research

### In Progress Projects

- **Research Project with Marketing School**: Can companies offer personalized services according to customers’ psychological profiles?

- **Research Project with Medical School**: Prediction of benign disease in MRI BI-RADS 4 breast lesions using intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics features: A multi-centre study. The study aims to develop and optimize a radiomics model with features extracted from breast intra- and peri-tumoral regions in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4, thereby obviating unnecessary biopsies.

- **Research Project**: Application of fine-grain image classification technology in agriculture (2023 - present).
